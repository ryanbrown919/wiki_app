**Know More Scrolling**

Like many, social media apps like Instagram offer hours of short-form content catered to user preferences designed to glue user's to their devices. I am sick and tired of wasting my time doing this, but I know that it is a hard habit to break.

Occasioanlly when I am bored, I click through the random article button on Wikipedia. Usually the articles are meanignless, but there is always one or two that are genuinely interesting and not something I would ever think about otherwise. 

This is why I am creating this app, to solve one problem with a more productive but habitually satisfying activity. By scrolling through this app instead of Intagram, at least soem interesting knowledge can be gained, and hopefully it will accelerate putting the device down for good.
